# Express.js API Gateway

  Introduction:
  This repository contains an API Gateway built using Express.js. An API Gateway is a server
  that acts as an entry point into a system of APIs, routing client requests to the appropriate
  microservices. This README provides an overview of the API Gateway's features, installation instructions,
  and usage guidelines.

  ## Features:
  - Routing: The API Gateway routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservices based on predefined rules.
  - Middleware: Supports middleware functions for logging, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.
  - Proxying: Acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to backend services.
  - Error Handling: Handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
  - Security: Implements security measures such as HTTPS, CORS policies, and input validation to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data.

  Installation:
  To install and run the API Gateway locally, follow these steps:

  1. Clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-gateway.git

  2. Install dependencies:

  cd api-gateway
  npm install

  3. Configure the gateway by modifying the config.js file according to your requirements.

  4. Start the server:

  npm start

  The API Gateway should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

  Usage:
  ## Routing

  Define routing rules in the routes.js file to specify how incoming requests should be routed to backend services.

  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const router = express.Router();

  // Example route
  router.get('/api/resource', (req, res, next) => {
      // Handle request logic here
  });

  module.exports = router;
```
